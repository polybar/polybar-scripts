# Script: system-usb-udev

A small script that shows your mounted and not mounted removable devices. This is an extended version of [system-usb-mount](../system-usb-mount).

Click left to mount all removable devices. Click right to unmount the devices. The removable devices are then turned off with `udisksctl power-off`.

The mount option has a feature: You can also start a file manager and open the device when you mount it. Look at the example in the code: `terminal -e "bash -lc 'filemanager $mountpoint'" &`

This script is able to display device changes in real time. For this udev is being used.
